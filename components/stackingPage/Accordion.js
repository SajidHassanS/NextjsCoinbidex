        content: `
          1. Interest is credited every day. If you stake on D (date), interest starts to accrue on D+1 and is paid on D+2. Coinbidex will pay interest to your spot account each day for as long as you keep staking.<br>
          2. You can stake at any time and redeem before the end of a staking period. Staking offers a flexible, free, and smooth experience.<br>
          3. You get as much as you earn on the chain. Coinbidex does not take a cut of your earnings, and the ROI exactly matches that of the nodes.<br>
          4. Earn principal-protected and low-risk income. Your assets will only grow during staking. No setup required, and no penalty (such as slashing) or other on-chain node staking risks. Coinbidex makes you an effortless earner!<br>

        content:
     `Redemption (Standard): If you stake on D (date), you can request a standard redemption on D+1. The redemption period aligns with the on-chain nodes. The staked tokens and interest (after deducting the service fee) will be distributed to your spot account after the redemption period. No interest will be generated during the redemption period.<br>
     Redemption (Express): If you stake on D (date), depending on the project, you can request an express redemption on D+3. The staked assets and the interest will be distributed to your spot account within 10 minutes, and the platform will deduct 10% of the proceeds as a service fee. The daily quota is limited — the portion that exceeds the quota can only be redeemed the next day.`,  },
